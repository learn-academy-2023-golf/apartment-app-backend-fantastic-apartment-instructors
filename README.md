# Authorization vs Authentication
- Authentication: providing credentials - user name and password
- Authorization: what you have access to when you are logged in

Devise is a gem that helps us with authentication and authorization

JWT: JSON Web Tokens are tokens passed from the backend to inform the frontend that a user is logged in and authenticated
